# Linux-Bot

A Discord bot with the following functionalities:
  1) Send the "GNU/Linux" copypasta anytime someone says the word "Linux" (non-case-sensitive) in any given Discord channel.
  2) Send a random animal picture using the tinyfox API: the current list of animals included thus far are foxes, dogs, deer, pine martens, possums, bunnies and hyenas.

To trigger the bot to send a picture of any animals listed above, simply type the name of said animal and the bot will send a random picture in return.

A list of trigger words can be found in .py file that the bot is contained within.



In order to run the bot, simply download the .py file (ensure you have the latest version of Python installed) and run it using  ```python discord_bot.py``` in Command Prompt (also make sure that CMD is navigated to the same directory as the .py file or else it won't run.)
